# Final project
This is a so called mono-repo, meaning it includes both frontend and backend. You will find three README files in this project, and how you decide to structure the information about your project is up to you.

---

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- Brief description of the assignment
- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
- If you had more time, what would be next?
- How to run the project locally


# Postinstall:

Ensures dependencies for both the frontend and backend are installed automatically when you run npm install in the root directory.
dev:

## Starts both the frontend and backend in development mode:
Frontend with vite.
Backend with nodemon.
start:

Starts the frontend and backend in production mode

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.


## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
